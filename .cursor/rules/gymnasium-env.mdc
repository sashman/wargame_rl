# Gymnasium Environment Patterns

## WargameEnv Structure

`WargameEnv` extends `gymnasium.Env` with typed observation and action spaces.

- **Observation**: `WargameEnvObservation` (Pydantic model) returned from `_get_obs()`
- **Action**: `WargameEnvAction` wrapping the multi-discrete action space
- **Info**: `WargameEnvInfo` (Pydantic model) returned from `_get_info()`
- **Config**: `WargameEnvConfig` (pydantic-yaml) loaded from YAML files in `examples/env_config/`

## Key Conventions

- Actions use polar coordinates: discrete (angle, speed) pairs per model
- `ActionHandler` encapsulates action space creation and application
- `DistanceCache` pre-computes distances between models and objectives each step
- Reward is computed by the `Reward` class in `reward/reward.py`
- Termination logic is in `env_components/termination.py`
- Placement logic randomizes starting positions within deployment zones

## Rendering

- Two render modes: `"human"` (Pygame window) and `"rgb_array"` (for video recording)
- Renderer is injected via constructor, not created internally

## Adding New Features

When modifying the environment:
1. Update `WargameEnvConfig` in `types/` if new config is needed
2. Add logic to the appropriate `env_components/` module
3. Update observation builder if the observation space changes
4. Update reward calculation if reward signals change
5. Add tests in `tests/test_env.py`
