# Workflow Preferences

## Task Runner

- Always use `just` to run tasks (train, test, lint, etc.) — never invoke `uv run` directly
- Default network type is transformer; do not default to MLP unless explicitly asked

## Naming & Design

- Prefer general, future-proof names over narrow ones (e.g. `models` not `model_placements`, `ModelConfig` not `ModelPlacement`)
- When adding per-entity configuration, make positional fields optional so attributes (stats, group, etc.) can be specified independently of placement
- Avoid hardcoded magic numbers in factory methods — push defaults into Pydantic models with `Field(default=...)`

## CUDA Environment

- The dev machine may have a broken CUDA setup; set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""` to force CPU when training fails with CUDA errors
