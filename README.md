# Wargame RL

The ultimate 2025 Python repository template. Simple, fast, customizable, and ready to use.

---
I wrote a blog post about this template! Check it out [here](https://giovannigiacometti.github.io/posts/python-template/)

## 🎯 Core Features

### Development Tools

- 📦 UV - Ultra-fast Python package manager
- 🚀 Just - Modern command runner with powerful features
- 💅 Ruff - Lightning-fast linter and formatter
- 🔍 Mypy - Static type checker
- 🧪 Pytest - Testing framework with fixtures and plugins
- 🧾 Loguru - Python logging made simple

### Infrastructure

- 🛫 Pre-commit hooks
- 🐳 Docker support with multi-stage builds and distroless images
- 🔄 GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline


## Usage

The template is based on [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/) as package manager and [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) as command runner. You need to have both installed in your system to use this template.

Once you have those, you can just run

```bash
just dev-sync
```

to create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies, including the development ones. If instead you want to build a "production-like" environment, you can run

```bash
just prod-sync
```

In both cases, all extra dependencies will be installed (notice that the current pyproject.toml file has no extra dependencies).

You also need to install the pre-commit hooks with:

```bash
just install-hooks
```

### Formatting, Linting and Testing

You can configure Ruff by editing the `.ruff.toml` file. It is currently set to the default configuration.

Format your code:

```bash
just format
```

Run linters (ruff and mypy):

```bash
just lint
```

Run tests:

```bash
just test
```

Do all of the above:

```bash
just validate
```

### Executing

#### Training

```bash
just run training
```

### Docker

The template includes a multi stage Dockerfile, which produces an image with the code and the dependencies installed. You can build the image with:

```bash
just dockerize
```

### Github Actions

The template includes two Github Actions workflows.

The first one runs tests and linters on every push on the main and dev branches. You can find the workflow file in `.github/workflows/main-list-test.yml`.

The second one is triggered on every tag push and can also be triggered manually. It builds the distribution and uploads it to PyPI. You can find the workflow file in `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`.
